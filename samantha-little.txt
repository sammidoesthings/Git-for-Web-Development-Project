Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        A block element pushes other elements out of their way by moving them to their own line. An inline element displays content on its left and right, on the same line.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
        It sits on its own layer separate from everything else, so that it does not interfere/interact with the layout of other elements.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        display block: <p> <div> <h1> - <h6> <header> <footer>
        display inline: <a> <span> <img>
        display inline-block: <button>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
